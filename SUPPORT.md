# Support Policy

Version 1 of the Terraform Plugin SDK is considered **end-of-life**, which means
the following support policy is in place:

- No new bug fixes or enhancements will be released.
- Providers will continue working, barring a change in Terraform that requires provider updates.

Provider developers are encouraged to update to a supported version of the SDK at their earliest convenience.

Please see the [upgrade
guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/guides/v2-upgrade-guide.html) for
information on how to upgrade to version 2.
